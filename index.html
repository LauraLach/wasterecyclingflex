          <h2>History of Waste in the United States</h2>
          <p>The Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill, opened in Fresno, California in 1937, is considered to have been the first modern, sanitary landfill in the United States. The Puente Hills Landfill is the largest landfill, with garbage towering over 490 ft from the ground since the area became a designated landfill site in 1957. In 1986, there were 7683 landfills in the United States. By 2009, there were just 1908 landfills nationwide, a 75% decline in disposal facilities in less than 25 years. However, this number is deceptive. Much of the decrease is due to consolidation of multiple landfills into a single, more efficient facility. Also, technology has allowed for each acre of landfill to take 30% more waste. In 1960, the generation of waste was 88.1 million tons, or 2.68 pounds per person per day. In 1980, it increased to 3.66 pounds per person per day. Then in 2000, it reached 4.74 pounds per person per day, and then decreased to 4.69 pounds per person per day in 2005. In 1960, landfilling of waste was 94% of the amount generated.</p>

          <h2>Recent Waste Statistics</h2>
          <p>In the United States in 2018, the total generation of waste was 292.4 million tons, or 4.9 pounds per person per day, an 8% increase from 2017. Of this, more than 146 million tons, around 50%, were landfilled. This decrease from 94% in 1960 to 50% in 2018 was a direct result of increased recycling rates. Currently, the United States is the #1 trash-producing country in the world; 5% of the world's population generates 40% of the world's waste.</p>
