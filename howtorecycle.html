        <img src="paper.png" class="howToPic" alt="paper">
        <p class="howToText">Notebook paper, magazines, receipts, envelopes, and cardboard boxes can all be recycled as paper. However, before disposing, make sure the paper is dry and clean, and any personal information is scratched out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="howToItem">
        <img src="plastic.jpg" class="howToPic" alt="plastic">
        <p class="howToText">A product made of plastic is often stamped with a resin code, which is a number between 1 and 7 inside a small triangle. Each number corresponds to a different type of plastic, and this number can indicate whether the item can be recycled or not. #1 and #2 plastics can be recycled, #4, #5, #6, and #7 plastics can sometimes be recycled, and #3 plastics, such as PVC pipes, cannot be recycled. Check with your local recycling facility to see which plastic items they will accept.</p>

      <div class="howToItem">
        <img src="glass.png" class="howToPic" alt="glass">
        <p class="howToText">All clear, clean glass bottles and jars can be recycled. However, many glass objects, such as drinkware and vases, usually cannot be recycled. In addition, colored glass bottles and jars can only sometimes be recycled. Check with your local recycling facility to see which glass items they will accept.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="howToItem">
        <img src="battery.jpg" class="howToPic" alt="battery">
        <p class="howToText">Most batteries, including lithium-ion, lithium metal, lead-acid, nickel cadmium, and other rechargeable batteries should not go in household garbage or recycling bins. These batteries require special handling and should be taken to specialty drop-off locations or household hazardous waste collection points.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="howToItem">
        <img src="tire.jpg" class="howToPic" alt="tire">
        <p class="howToText">Tires usually cannot be recycled at regular recycling facilities. Most garages are required to accept and recycle your used tires when you have new ones installed, or you may be able to return used tires to either a tire retailer or a local recycling facility that accepts tires.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="howToItem">
        <img src="paint.jpg" class="howToPic" alt="paint">
        <p class="howToText">Leftover household products that contain corrosive, toxic, ignitable, or reactive ingredients are considered to be household hazardous waste (HHW). Products such as paints, cleaners, light bulbs, and pesticides that contain potentially hazardous ingredients require special care when you dispose of them. HHW may be dangerous to people or bad for the environment if poured down the drain, dumped on the ground, or thrown out with regular trash or recycling.</p>

      <div class="howToItem">
        <img src="oil.png" class="howToPic" alt="motor oil">
        <p class="howToText">Never dump your used motor oil down the drain â€” the used oil from one oil change can contaminate one million gallons of fresh water. To dispose of motor oil, find a local motor oil recycler.</p>
