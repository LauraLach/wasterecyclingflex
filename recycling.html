          <h2>History of Recycling</h2>
          <p>The first recorded use of recycling was in 9th century Japan. Japanese people began recycling paper almost as soon as they learned how to produce it, and recycling became part of paper production and consumption. In 1690, recycling reached the United States. The Rittenhouse Mill in Philadelphia began recycling linen and cotton rags for use in Bibles and newspapers. Hundreds of years later, recycling became much more prelavent due to World War II's campaigns for tin, rubber, steel, paper and more. In 1976, Massachusetts became the first to implement weekly multi-material curbside collection programs and used the first ever residential recycling truck. By 1985, the United States was at 10% nationwide recycling participation. Then by 1995, it was at 20% nationwide recycling participation. In 1998, it reached 30%.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of Recycling</h2>
          <p>Recycling is beneficial for many reasons. One of which is because it saves resources. For instance, if a bottle can be made from recycled glass, less new materials need to be used. Another benefit is that recycling saves energy. It takes much less energy to produce an item from recycled items than it does to produce it from new items. For instance, it takes 95% less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from raw materials. Recycling can also help protect the environment. It reduces the need for extracting, refining, and processing raw materials, all of which create substantial air and water pollution. Also, as recycling saves energy, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, recycling helps keep landfills from expanding.</p>

          <h2>Recent Recycling Statistics</h2>
          <p>In 2018, Americans recycled about 68% of the paper they used. However, they recycled only 8.7% of plastics used. Overall, almost 94 million tons of waste was recycled and composted, equivalent to a 32.1% recycling and composting rate.</p>

          <h2>Issue With Improper Recycling</h2>
          <p>When someone puts an item into a recycling bin with the hope that it can in fact be recycled, this is called wishcycling. This can be problematic because putting non-recyclable items into a recycling bin can clog up the recycling machines and injure the operation crew. In addition, if a recyclable item is contaminated, such as an unwashed peanut butter jar, it can contaminate an entire load of recyclable items. Therefore, it is imperative that all items are recycled properly. Click on the navigation bar's "How To Recycle" tab to see how to properly recycle items.</p>
